### As a working mom of one :family:, I am transitioning from an education background into Software Engineering. 

My developer journey started from making snowmen with different shapes of eyes/head for my son for fun, to a full blown passion. :yellow_heart:

I am self-taught developer who has been mentored by a mid-level software developer. 👩‍🏫

While currently moulding young lives as a middle school Mathematics teacher, I am very excited to land my first developer job and continue to learn in the wonderful world of tech. 💻

Thanks for reading! 📖
